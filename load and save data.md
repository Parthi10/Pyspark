# Loading and saving data

My learning: Better to focus on dataframe APIs for this part, they are more robust and provide more flexibility.

## text files

`rdd = sc.textFile("file:///home/work/input.txt")`
`rdd.saveAsTextFile()`

## JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a text format for the serialization of structured data. It is derived from the object literals of JavaScript 
JSON can represent four primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) and two structured types (objects and arrays).
python json module seem to be good to convert python objects to json structure.
dataframe APIs seem to be better. more on this later.
